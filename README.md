# Machine Learning Algorithms with Pure Numpy
In 2018, before I got a job as machine learning engineer, I finished [data scientist path on dataquest](https://app.dataquest.io/verify_cert/KIQA63ATX2UUQU9AYTTA/) and [deep learning specialization taught by Andrew Ng](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/).
I learnt both machine learning and deep learning algorithms from these courses. During the last one year, I solved several real life problem with these techniques. In order to review these machine learning algorithm, I plan to code these algorithms with pure numpy in my spare time.

# Project Strctures
1. data/  data directory
2. src/   source code
3. Unittest/ unittest for source code
4. deep_learning_courser_note/  course note for deep learning specialization

# Finished
1. [Neural Network](src/NNModel.py)
